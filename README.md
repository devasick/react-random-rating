                                Assignment for Frontend Developer

Demo URL :  http://asickweb.com/movie-rating/

1. Pick your top 10+ fav books, movies, video games, food, or whatever you
wish. Build an Angular + ngrx/store or react-redux app that lists these
items. Initial list of any of these item can be stored in json file no
need to write a backend service.
2. Create a rating system where you can rate each item. Order the list by
the highest rated item to lowest rated item. Re-order the list, if needed,
when user ranks an item.
3. Using RxJS or any other library, randomly rate items at random times,
also re-ordering the list as necessary. To elaborate this more put a
button called RANDOM RATING and on click of this button code will start
rating random item at random time with random rating. And on same button
press again it will stop random rating.
4. Feel free to use any UI elements or library.
5. Focus on test driven approach while coding this assignment.
6. Git repo with commit messages will be a plus.
